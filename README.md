## Overview

Used Sass and some basic html to create an order summary card built mobile first, but responsive at many sizes.

### The challenge

## My process

I have been wanted to break down some of the technologies I have worked with into smaller parts to better understand them. For such simple task, I thought setting some basic Sass and practicing the .sass indent formatting would be interesting as I had some fun learning it in a previous project. I used the basic skeloton provided and worked from top down doing my best to replicate the design images.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Dart-Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I mostly too a small dive into the history of Sass and its evolution to the most widely used Dart-Sass. Used the most basic version with npm script to watch the files for changes. 

I learned a bit more about hsl color system and mixing systems, by making a sass variable and using it in a rgba color we can change the opacity on the fly.

```
    box-shadow: 0px 15px 15px rgba($DesaturatedBlue, 0.3)
```

This alloud me to use the same color for a shadow but lighten it up a bit quickly.

### Continued development

I think future challenges will be either react or web components to start building a libray of reusable components for future projects

### Useful resources

- [Sass Doc's](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - I looked a couple of different places first, but nothing usually beats the documentation, sprinkled with some patience.
- [Steve Griffins Intro Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jZGo_k8Rd0) - Sometimes you just need a visual aid, I was just having trouble connecting some dots.
